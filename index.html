    <h2>1. because they are 99% self sufficient</h2>
    <p>
      Cats are very proud animals and like to be independant, so unlike dogs
      cats take pleasure in keeping themselves clean. Cats dont need as mush
      attention as dogs so they are perfect if u have a very busy lifestyle.

      <h2>2. because they are amusing</h2>
      Cats are naturally curious and love exploring,however their curiosity tends to get the better of them and when that happens they find themselves in sticky situaitions that we humans find amusing and funny

      <h2>3. because they are emtional</h2>
     Just like humans cats have feelings (eventhough most people think they dont) and therefore make great compainions.
